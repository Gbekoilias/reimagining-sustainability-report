Nestlé has faced several criticisms and challenges in achieving its sustainability goals under Group 6 (Climate Action, Life Below Water, Life on Land). These criticisms often stem from various stakeholders, including NGOs, academic studies, and media reports. Here are some key points highlighting the gaps and failures in their strategies:

1. Deforestation and Land Use:

- NGO Reports: Organizations like Greenpeace have criticized Nestlé for its role in deforestation linked to palm oil and other commodity sourcing. Reports have highlighted that despite commitments to eliminate deforestation from its supply chain, Nestlé has been associated with suppliers that contribute to forest degradation. Greenpeace has called for more stringent measures and transparency in sourcing practices .

- Academic Studies: Research has shown that large multinational corporations, including Nestlé, often struggle to fully trace their supply chains, leading to challenges in ensuring that all sourced materials are deforestation-free. This lack of traceability can undermine the effectiveness of sustainability commitments .

2. Water Management Issues:

- Community Concerns: Nestlé has faced backlash over its water extraction practices, particularly in regions experiencing water scarcity. Critics argue that the company's bottled water operations can exacerbate local water shortages, impacting communities and ecosystems. Reports from NGOs have documented instances where Nestlé's water extraction has led to conflicts with local communities over water rights .

- Sustainability Rankings: While Nestlé has made strides in reducing water use in its factories, some sustainability rankings have pointed out that the company still faces significant challenges in managing water resources sustainably across its entire supply chain, particularly in water-stressed regions .

3. Greenwashing Allegations:

- Media Criticism: Nestlé has been accused of "greenwashing," where the company's sustainability claims are perceived as more about marketing than genuine environmental commitment. Critics argue that while Nestlé promotes its sustainability initiatives, the scale and impact of these efforts may not align with the company's overall environmental footprint .

- Academic Studies: Some studies have suggested that large corporations like Nestlé may prioritize short-term sustainability goals that are easier to achieve while neglecting more complex, long-term challenges such as systemic changes in agricultural practices and supply chain management .

4. Biodiversity Loss:

- Research Findings: Studies have indicated that despite Nestlé's commitments to biodiversity and sustainable sourcing, the company's agricultural practices can still contribute to biodiversity loss. The reliance on monoculture farming and intensive agricultural practices in some supply chains has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of these approaches .

- NGO Reports: Environmental organizations have pointed out that Nestlé's efforts to promote regenerative agriculture are still in the early stages and need to be scaled up significantly to make a meaningful impact on biodiversity conservation .

5. Stakeholder Engagement:

- Criticism from Local Communities: Nestlé has faced challenges in effectively engaging with local communities and stakeholders in its sustainability initiatives. Reports have highlighted instances where community voices were not adequately considered in decision-making processes, leading to tensions and conflicts over resource use .




Nestlé has faced several criticisms and challenges in its efforts to achieve sustainability goals under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) related to **Climate Action**, **Life Below Water**, and **Life on Land**. Here are some key issues highlighted by various reports and studies:

## Transparency and Reporting Gaps

### Criticism from Ethos
Ethos, a Swiss foundation representing a coalition of investors, has criticized Nestlé for its **lack of transparency** in its sustainability reporting. Key concerns include:

- **Insufficient Detail on Emissions**: The company has been criticized for not adequately disclosing its **Scope 3 emissions**, which refer to indirect emissions across its supply chain. Ethos noted that these emissions are not categorized as required by the GHG protocol, making it difficult to assess the full environmental impact of Nestlé's operations[1][3].
- **Lack of Audit Results**: Ethos also pointed out that Nestlé failed to publish results from audits concerning human rights and child labor, which are critical issues within its supply chain. This lack of information raises concerns about the company's commitment to ethical practices[1][3].

### Overall Sustainability Report
In its 2023 sustainability report, while acknowledging some progress, Ethos deemed the overall transparency insufficient for a company of Nestlé's scale, particularly regarding capital expenditures related to climate goals and measures taken to meet those targets[1][3].

## Environmental Challenges

### Deforestation and Land Rights
Despite Nestlé's commitments to deforestation-free sourcing, challenges remain in addressing deforestation and land rights issues. Reports indicate that the company has struggled with ensuring sustainable sourcing practices, particularly concerning palm oil and soy, which have been linked to habitat destruction and biodiversity loss[2][4]. NGOs like Greenpeace have criticized Nestlé for sourcing palm oil from suppliers associated with deforestation, which negatively impacts endangered species[2].

### Plastic Waste Management
Nestlé's efforts to reduce plastic waste have also faced scrutiny. Although the company has committed to industry-led solutions, it must implement specific packaging design rules by 2025. Critics argue that without innovative solutions to minimize waste and increase recycling rates, Nestlé's impact on marine life will continue to be significant[2].

## Social Responsibility Issues

### Labor Practices
Oxfam International has raised concerns regarding labor practices within Nestlé's supply chain, accusing the company of not adequately addressing issues such as poverty wages and unfair labor conditions among small-scale farmers. This criticism highlights the need for greater accountability in ensuring fair treatment throughout its supply chain[2].

### Healthier Product Initiatives
Investor coalitions have also expressed disappointment with Nestlé’s nutrition targets, deeming them insufficient in promoting healthier products. They argue that without specific, measurable targets for increasing sales of nutritious foods, Nestlé risks falling short of its social responsibility commitments[1][3].

## Conclusion

Overall, while Nestlé has made strides in certain areas related to sustainability and environmental stewardship, significant challenges remain. Critics emphasize the need for improved transparency in reporting, effective management of environmental impacts like deforestation and plastic waste, and stronger commitments to social responsibility within its supply chain. Addressing these criticisms will be crucial for Nestlé as it seeks to align more closely with UNSDG targets under Group 6.
