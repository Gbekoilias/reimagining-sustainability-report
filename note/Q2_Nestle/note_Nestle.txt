Nestlé has implemented several initiatives that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG), particularly in Group 6, which focuses on Climate Action, Life Below Water, and Life on Land. Here are some key programs and partnerships:
Ocean Restoration Program
Nestlé Purina PetCare Europe has launched an Ocean Restoration Program aimed at restoring marine biodiversity across Europe. This initiative is designed to restore up to 1,500 hectares of marine habitats by 2030, equivalent to approximately 3,700 football pitches. The program focuses on several critical areas, including:
Seagrass meadow restoration: Collaborating with The Seagrass Consortium to enhance carbon sequestration and biodiversity.
Oyster reef reconstruction: Partnering with Oyster Heaven to rebuild depleted oyster reefs, which are essential for marine ecosystems.
Sea urchin control: Working with Urchinomics to manage sea urchin populations that threaten kelp forests.
Seaweed restoration: Engaging with SeaForester to implement mobile seaweed nurseries for restoring depleted seaweed forests135.
This program not only addresses biodiversity loss but also supports Nestlé's commitment to ensuring that 100% of its seafood ingredients are responsibly sourced or organic13.
Norwegian Marine Restoration Platform
Nestlé Purina is also a founding member of the Norwegian Marine Restoration (NoMaRe) platform, which aims to restore crucial marine ecosystems in Norway, particularly focusing on kelp forest restoration across a significant area of Northern Norway. The platform seeks to influence policies and secure funding for marine restoration efforts through collaboration with various stakeholders, including non-profits and aquaculture firms79.
Climate Action Goals
Nestlé has set ambitious climate action targets as part of its sustainability strategy. The company aims to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with an interim goal of halving emissions by 2030. This holistic approach includes efforts in sustainable sourcing, waste reduction, and improving water stewardship810.
Summary
Through these initiatives, Nestlé is actively contributing to the UNSDGs related to climate action and marine conservation. Their collaborative efforts not only focus on environmental restoration but also emphasize sustainable practices within their supply chains, showcasing a commitment to both ecological health and corporate responsibility.
