Political Factors:
Unilever has a huge product portfolio with the company mainly working in the following divisions: Beauty & Personal Care, Food & refreshment, Home Care and Water purifier. Most of the revenues which it generates are from the Fast Moving Consumer goods. So, Unilever needs to abide by the regulations set by the Food and Drug Administration. Also, in foreign nations, where it is set up, it needs to abide by its laws. One of the major political factors which will hit Unilever hardly is the stance of present U.S.A. government. The Trump government might come up with new regulations i.e. introducing stricter trade reforms which will make foreign companies lives difficult. Being a European company, Unilever is likely to face the consequences if these regulations came into implementation. Also, a strong government in the centre is a good signal for the corporate as it will then become easier to introduce corporate friendly reforms without much of a resistance from the opposition.
