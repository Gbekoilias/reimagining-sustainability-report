Unilever's sustainability activities align closely with several global frameworks such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UN Declaration of Human Rights, and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, demonstrating its commitment to responsible business practices that support global health, environmental stewardship, and social progress.

Alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being): Unilever’s health and hygiene initiatives, including campaigns that reached over 1 billion people with handwashing education, directly contribute to public health and the prevention of disease outbreaks. Products from brands like Lifebuoy and Dove support hygiene practices that promote well-being and reduce the spread of infections.
SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production): Unilever’s focus on sustainable packaging, aiming for 100% recyclable, reusable, or compostable materials by 2025, aligns with SDG 12’s commitment to sustainable production. Its push to cut down virgin plastic use by 50% by 2025 is an essential effort to minimize environmental impact and promote resource efficiency.
SDG 13 (Climate Action): The company’s ambitious climate strategy, which includes achieving net-zero emissions by 2039 and the use of 100% renewable energy across its global operations, directly supports efforts to combat climate change. This includes both reducing direct emissions (Scope 1 and 2) and collaborating with suppliers to address indirect emissions (Scope 3).
SDG 5 (Gender Equality): Unilever’s progress toward gender parity in its workforce, achieving 50% female representation as of 2022, reflects its commitment to promoting gender equality in line with SDG 5. Moreover, initiatives supporting women’s empowerment in supply chains and communities strengthen its alignment with this goal.
Alignment with the UN Declaration of Human Rights:

Ethical Labor Practices: Unilever’s stringent supplier audits and its ethical labor standards are in line with the UN Declaration of Human Rights, particularly in areas concerning the prohibition of forced and child labor and the assurance of safe working conditions. By holding suppliers accountable and fostering fair wages and safe environments, Unilever helps safeguard human rights within its operations and supply chains.
Community Development: Programs that focus on empowering marginalized communities, such as those aimed at increasing the economic participation of women and youth, contribute to fulfilling the principles set out by the Declaration, which emphasizes equal rights and opportunities for all individuals.
Alignment with World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines:

Health and Hygiene Education: Unilever’s partnerships and educational programs that promote handwashing and good hygiene practices align with WHO guidelines for global health improvement. By increasing awareness and access to hygiene products, Unilever contributes to preventing diseases and supporting public health, a priority outlined in WHO recommendations.
Sustainable Health Solutions: The development of products that are sustainably sourced and promote well-being, such as health-focused personal care items, also aligns with WHO’s calls for promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing health risks associated with environmental factors.
